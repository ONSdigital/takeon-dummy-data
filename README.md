# Dummy Data
The present repo consists of a series of python scripts that can be used to generate consistant dummy data for an arbitary (single instance) form. All that is needed is a json file that corisponds to the form definition. The tests scripts use the "Monthly Neutronium" test form, all other form definitions must follow the format layed out in Monthly Neutronium.

# edge_case_data
In edge case data we have a series of PostgreSQL scripts that can insert data into our database. This data is meant to be respresentive of data that _might_ end up being taken on, but which isn't typical.
