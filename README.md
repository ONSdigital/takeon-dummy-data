# Dummy Data
The present repo consists of a series of python scripts that can be used to generate consistant dummy data for an arbitary (single instance) form. All that is needed is a json file that corisponds to the form definition. The tests scripts use the "Monthly Neutronium" test form, all other form definitions must follow the format layed out in Monthly Neutronium.
